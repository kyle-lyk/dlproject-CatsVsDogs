# dlproject-catsvsdogs
-------
## Intro
This is my very first machine learning (deep learning) project, <br>
which is used to train the machine to recognize whether the input image is a cat or dog. <br>
Info and Datasets are obtained from Kaggle website (link provided in info). <br>
Sample codes for CNN algorithms obtained from TFLearn tutorial by sentdex (link provided in info - references) <br>
